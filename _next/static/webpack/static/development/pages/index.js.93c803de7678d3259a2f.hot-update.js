Travellers with symptoms of COVID-19 will be escorted to an isolation facility for further COVID-19 testing (travellers without symptoms will also be tested for COVID-19 in a separate facility). If test results are positive, patients will be escorted to designated hospitals or other medical facilities for treatment.
