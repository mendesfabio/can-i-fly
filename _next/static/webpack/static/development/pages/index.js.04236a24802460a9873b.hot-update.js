Temporary suspension of visa-free entry for foreigners from countries that imposed entry restrictions on Korean nationals. This measure will be applied to countries with an entry ban on South Korean nationals, including 56 countries that have signed a visa-free agreement with South Korea and 34 countries that are allowed to enter Korea without visas. All passengers arriving in South Korea from overseas will be required to undergo two weeks of self-isolation.Those without local residence in South Korea will be quarantined at a government facility with a cost of approximately KRW100,000 per day. Mandatory testing of COVID-19 and 14-day quarantine is required for travellers (regardless of nationality) arriving from Europe. Travellers who hold A-1 visa, A-3 agreement visa, diplomats and their families are exempt from the 14-day mandatory self-isolation. Exemptions can also be made for travellers who receive permission from a South Korean Embassy to travel for the purposes of business, humanitarian work or participation in an academic forum. A fast-track procedure has been introduced to facilitate business travel with China. Business travellers from China need to submit a document certifying a negative COVID-19 test result within 72 hours before departure and satisfy the disease control requirement. A quarantine exemption document will then be issued by the Korean authorities. Once the traveller undergoes another COVID-19 testing upon arrival in South Korea with a negative test result, the person can enter the country and engage in business activities while under active surveillance. Travellers with symptoms of COVID-19 will be escorted to an isolation facility for further COVID-19 testing (travellers without symptoms will also be tested for COVID-19 in a separate facility). If test results are positive, patients will be escorted to designated hospitals or other medical facilities for treatment. All violators (incl. foreigners) of the self-quarantine requirement will be punished by relevant statutory law. International travellers can transit if they do not clear immigration and stay within the transit area for up to 24 hours.

Those who do not have access to private vehicles are to use designated buses and trains allocated for these travellers. Visas issued to nationals of Japan (at Korean diplomatic missions in Japan) before 9 March 2020 are invalidated and visa exemption has been suspended.

Foreign nationals involved in necessary economic, trade, scientific or technological activities or for emergency and humanitarian needs may also apply for visas at Chinese embassies or consulates.\\nMany local governments require inbound travellers to inform their local company office and neighbourhood committee in advance about their travel plan.\\nThe number of international passenger flights is reduced. In Beijing, international flights are not landing directly at Beijing Capital International Airport (PEK), but are diverted first to other domestic airports in Dalian, Hohhot, Jinan, Nanjing, Qingdao, Shanghai Pudong, Shenyang, Shijiazhuang, Taiyuan, Tianjin, Xi\\u2019an and Zhengzhou for screening. Travellers will have to undergo a 14-day quarantine at a designated facility upon entry. After clearing the 14-day quarantine, if the traveller enters Beijing after the second day the traveller clears the quarantine, the traveller will have to undergo another 14-day quarantine either at home or a designated facility for 14 additional days.\\nAll land border crossings between China and Russia have been closed to travellers. Yunnan province has banned citizens from leaving the country by more than 30 land and river ports at the province\\u2019s borders with Vietnam, Laos, and Myanmar.\\nThe Chinese Government is in discussions with foreign governments on \\\"fast-track\\\" procedures to allow key employees of foreign companies to return to China. So far, \\\"fast-track\\\" commercial charter flights have been arranged with Germany and South Korea and may be extended to other countries in the future.\\nAll transit/transfer services, including air transit/transfer, cross boundary land transport and cross boundary ferry transfer, are suspended for all passengers at Hong Kong International Airport.\\nResidents with travel history in Daegu and Gyeongsangbuk-do in South Korea, Iran, as well as Emilia-Romagna, Lombardy and Veneto regions in Italy in the past 14 days will be required upon entry to stay in a quarantine centre for 14 days. Residents with travel history in any other overseas locations in the preceding 14 days will be subject to a 14-day mandatory quarantine.\\n\\nInternal restrictions:\\nMainland China: Railway stations and airports have gradually resumed operations and most provinces have resumed their inter-provincial road passenger transportation. Restrictions on public transportation and private car movement have been lifted in most cities.\\nHubei province: Restrictions on outbound travel from Hubei province were lifted on 25 March, and restrictions in Wuhan have been lifted on 8 April. Railway and passenger flights have started to resume accordingly with the lifting of restrictions (Wuhan Tianhe International Airport resumed domestic flights on 8 April); however, international flights and flights to/from Beijing will remain suspended until further notice. Those who want to leave Hubei should confirm with their destination city on the local requirements. Various cities and provinces require all travellers from Wuhan to take nucleic acid tests (including Shenzhen, Zhejiang, etc). Shanghai encourages employers to let returning staff from certain areas take nucleic acid tests.\\nBeijing: On 29 April, the Beijing government announced a new policy that business travellers and returnees who come from domestic \\u2018COVID-19 low risk\\u2019 areas to Beijing will NOT need the 14 days of home quarantine. People who have travelled from low risk areas to Beijing and are currently under home quarantine can halt their home quarantine and medical observation if applicable. The new Beijing policy does not apply to travellers from overseas, Hubei province or other domestic \\u2018medium and high risk areas\\u2019. Personnel returning from Hubei need to register information online in advance and get a negative nucleic acid test certificate before purchasing the returning ticket. After arrival, they need to show the test certificate to enter the community, follow the 14-day quarantine requirement, and take another test before lifting the quarantine. Domestic travellers planning to stay at hotels must present a \\u2018green\\u2019 health code. Chaoyang District has been rated as \\u2018high\\u2019 risk due to recent cluster cases. Travellers from 'high' risk areas are possible to face quarantine and other requirements when entering other provinces and cities. As such requirements vary across the country, travellers need to confirm with the local residence committee or hotel in advance.\\nAs the situation continues to improve across the country, almost all the cities and provinces have declared the local risk level to be low. The latest city is Suifenhe, the border city with Russia in Heilongjiang province, who adjusted its risk level to low from May 6. However, some cities also chose to strengthen their quarantine measures due to re-emergence of local or imported cases. On 10 May, Shulan (Jilin province) raised its risk level to \\u2018high\\u2019 due to new local cases, and has re-strengthened restrictions on local movement and public gathering. Several train routes to/from Shulan have also been suspended.All villages and residential compounds in the city were closed off, and only one person from each household allowed out for two hours every second day for essentials. (The Guardian, 19.05.2020) \\n\\nAnother example is Taiyuan (who did so on 3 May), Shanxi provincial capital, although it didn\\u2019t announce any change to its risk or response level. In Shanghai and Guangdong, public health emergency response levels have been changed from level II to level III.\\nA new directive has been issued providing more detailed guidance on community quarantine management, including a new clause that says for low-risk areas and communities with no cases detected, inbound travellers from non-high-risk areas are exempted from mandatory quarantine as long as they hold a \\u2018green\\u2019 health code and arrive directly (without a stopover in a high-risk area). As the risk levels still vary across the country, travellers are advised to confirm with the local residence committee or hotel about quarantine requirements in advance.\\nAs each province has different variations of the application, travellers will need to check the relevant application for their destination and register their information online to get the \\u2018health code\\u2019 before the trip. Heilongjiang announced an \\u2018in-city code\\u2019 in addition to the three-colour health code. Personnel with \\u2018in-city code\\u2019 are restricted to travel out of their current city but can move freely inside.\\nAlthough such restrictions are easing, many provinces and cities still have in place community 'close-off' style management which means:\\nA reduction of exit/entry access to the community.\\nAccess control of visitors and visiting vehicles: ID check/registration, temperature measurement at gate, delivery service is to be picked up at the gate of community etc.\\nIf there are confirmed cases in a certain community, there might be a closure of certain units/areas for quarantine depending on the severity of the local outbreak. In Heilongjiang province, re-emergence of local cases has led to strengthening of such measures.\\nOn 13 May, Jilin city was announced to be \\u2018sealed\\u2019. Transportations services such as intercity buses and trains for Jilin city are suspended now. People who want to move out of the city need the nucleic acid test within 48 hours of travel and register the information according to official instructions.\"],updated_at:\"2020-05-19\",source:\"https://pandemic.internationalsos.com/2019-ncov/ncov-travel-restrictions-flight-operations-and-screening\\nhttps://china.usembassy-china.org.cn/covid-19-information/\",certification_status:\"COVID-19 negative certification subject to special conditions\"}],CG:[{info:[\"International restrictions:\\nLand, air and sea borders are closed and all international flights are suspended.
