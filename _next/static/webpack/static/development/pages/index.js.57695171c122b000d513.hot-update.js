The new Beijing policy does not apply to travellers from overseas, Hubei province or other domestic \\u2018medium and high risk areas\\u2019. Personnel returning from Hubei need to register information online in advance and get a negative nucleic acid test certificate before purchasing the returning ticket.

On 10 May, Shulan (Jilin province) raised its risk level to \\u2018high\\u2019 due to new local cases, and has re-strengthened restrictions on local movement and public gathering.

As the risk levels still vary across the country, travellers are advised to confirm with the local residence committee or hotel about quarantine requirements in advance.\\nAs each province has different variations of the application, travellers will need to check the relevant application for their destination and register their information online to get the \\u2018health code\\u2019 before the trip.

(TTG Asia, 21.05.2020) \\n\\nInternational restrictions:\\nAll visas issued on or before 5 April are invalidated. Temporary suspension of visa-free entry for foreigners from countries that imposed entry restrictions on Korean nationals. This measure will be applied to countries with an entry ban on South Korean nationals, including 56 countries that have signed a visa-free agreement with South Korea and 34 countries that are allowed to enter Korea without visas. All passengers arriving in South Korea from overseas will be required to undergo two weeks of self-isolation.Those without local residence in South Korea will be quarantined at a government facility with a cost of approximately KRW100,000 per day. Mandatory testing of COVID-19 and 14-day quarantine is required for travellers (regardless of nationality) arriving from Europe. Travellers who hold A-1 visa, A-3 agreement visa, diplomats and their families are exempt from the 14-day mandatory self-isolation. Exemptions can also be made for travellers who receive permission from a South Korean Embassy to travel for the purposes of business, humanitarian work or participation in an academic forum. A fast-track procedure has been introduced to facilitate business travel with China. Business travellers from China need to submit a document certifying a negative COVID-19 test result within 72 hours before departure and satisfy the disease control requirement. A quarantine exemption document will then be issued by the Korean authorities. Once the traveller undergoes another COVID-19 testing upon arrival in South Korea with a negative test result, the person can enter the country and engage in business activities while under active surveillance. Travellers with symptoms of COVID-19 will be escorted to an isolation facility for further COVID-19 testing (travellers without symptoms will also be tested for COVID-19 in a separate facility). If test results are positive, patients will be escorted to designated hospitals or other medical facilities for treatment. All violators (incl. foreigners) of the self-quarantine requirement will be punished by relevant statutory law. International travellers can transit if they do not clear immigration and stay within the transit area for up to 24 hours.

Airlines are required to check the body temperature of all travellers to South Korea prior to departure. Travellers with a body temperature higher than 37.5 degrees Celsius will be denied entry. All travellers are advised to use private vehicles to transit to their place of residence from the airport. Those who do not have access to private vehicles are to use designated buses and trains allocated for these travellers. Visas issued to nationals of Japan (at Korean diplomatic missions in Japan) before 9 March 2020 are invalidated and visa exemption has been suspended. This does not apply to visas issued outside Japan; such visas remain valid. This also does not apply to airline crew.
