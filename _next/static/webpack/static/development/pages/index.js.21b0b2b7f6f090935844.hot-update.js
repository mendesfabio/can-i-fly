Temporary suspension of visa-free entry for foreigners from countries that imposed entry restrictions on Korean nationals. This measure will be applied to countries with an entry ban on South Korean nationals, including 56 countries that have signed a visa-free agreement with South Korea and 34 countries that are allowed to enter Korea without visas. All passengers arriving in South Korea from overseas will be required to undergo two weeks of self-isolation.Those without local residence in South Korea will be quarantined at a government facility with a cost of approximately KRW100,000 per day. Mandatory testing of COVID-19 and 14-day quarantine is required for travellers (regardless of nationality) arriving from Europe. Travellers who hold A-1 visa, A-3 agreement visa, diplomats and their families are exempt from the 14-day mandatory self-isolation. Exemptions can also be made for travellers who receive permission from a South Korean Embassy to travel for the purposes of business, humanitarian work or participation in an academic forum. A fast-track procedure has been introduced to facilitate business travel with China. Business travellers from China need to submit a document certifying a negative COVID-19 test result within 72 hours before departure and satisfy the disease control requirement. A quarantine exemption document will then be issued by the Korean authorities. Once the traveller undergoes another COVID-19 testing upon arrival in South Korea with a negative test result, the person can enter the country and engage in business activities while under active surveillance. Travellers with symptoms of COVID-19 will be escorted to an isolation facility for further COVID-19 testing (travellers without symptoms will also be tested for COVID-19 in a separate facility). If test results are positive, patients will be escorted to designated hospitals or other medical facilities for treatment. All violators (incl. foreigners) of the self-quarantine requirement will be punished by relevant statutory law. International travellers can transit if they do not clear immigration and stay within the transit area for up to 24 hours.
