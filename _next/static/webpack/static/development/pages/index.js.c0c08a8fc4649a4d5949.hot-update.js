Railway and passenger flights have started to resume accordingly with the lifting of restrictions (Wuhan Tianhe International Airport resumed domestic flights on 8 April); however, international flights and flights to/from Beijing will remain suspended until further notice. Those who want to leave Hubei should confirm with their destination city on the local requirements. Various cities and provinces require all travellers from Wuhan to take nucleic acid tests (including Shenzhen, Zhejiang, etc). Shanghai encourages employers to let returning staff from certain areas take nucleic acid tests.\\nBeijing: On 29 April, the Beijing government announced a new policy that business travellers and returnees who come from domestic \\u2018COVID-19 low risk\\u2019 areas to Beijing will NOT need the 14 days of home quarantine. People who have travelled from low risk areas to Beijing and are currently under home quarantine can halt their home quarantine and medical observation if applicable. The new Beijing policy does not apply to travellers from overseas, Hubei province or other domestic \\u2018medium and high risk areas\\u2019. Personnel returning from Hubei need to register information online in advance and get a negative nucleic acid test certificate before purchasing the returning ticket.

The latest city is Suifenhe, the border city with Russia in Heilongjiang province, who adjusted its risk level to low from May 6.

On 10 May, Shulan (Jilin province) raised its risk level to \\u2018high\\u2019 due to new local cases, and has re-strengthened restrictions on local movement and public gathering. Several train routes to/from Shulan have also been suspended.All villages and residential compounds in the city were closed off, and only one person from each household allowed out for two hours every second day for essentials.

As the risk levels still vary across the country, travellers are advised to confirm with the local residence committee or hotel about quarantine requirements in advance.\\nAs each province has different variations of the application, travellers will need to check the relevant application for their destination and register their information online to get the \\u2018health code\\u2019 before the trip. Heilongjiang announced an \\u2018in-city code\\u2019 in addition to the three-colour health code.

Travellers who hold A-1 visa, A-3 agreement visa, diplomats and their families are exempt from the 14-day mandatory self-isolation. Exemptions can also be made for travellers who receive permission from a South Korean Embassy to travel for the purposes of business, humanitarian work or participation in an academic forum. A fast-track procedure has been introduced to facilitate business travel with China. Business travellers from China need to submit a document certifying a negative COVID-19 test result within 72 hours before departure and satisfy the disease control requirement. A quarantine exemption document will then be issued by the Korean authorities. Once the traveller undergoes another COVID-19 testing upon arrival in South Korea with a negative test result, the person can enter the country and engage in business activities while under active surveillance. Travellers with symptoms of COVID-19 will be escorted to an isolation facility for further COVID-19 testing (travellers without symptoms will also be tested for COVID-19 in a separate facility). If test results are positive, patients will be escorted to designated hospitals or other medical facilities for treatment.

Domestic train services connecting the capital Tashkent to cities including Navoi, Bukhara, Karshi and Andijan will also resume.\\nThe national quarantine is extended to 1 June while some restrictions on businesses have been gradually lifted based on the three levels of quarantine which have been applied regionally according to the number of COVID-19 cases. The three quarantine levels are defined as red, yellow and green. Each region has been assigned a quarantine level and movement restrictions have been applied according to the level assigned.\\nThe red level applies to regions where COVID-19 cases have been confirmed within the last 14 days. Andijan, Bukhara, Fergana, Karakalpakstan, Namangan, Samarkand, Sirdarya and Tashkent (excluding Tashkent city) regions have been designated as red zones. In these regions, existing quarantine measures remain in place, including internal movement restrictions mandating that all residents stay home, except for essential purposes or for work. Only essential and approved businesses are allowed to operate, including pharmacies, grocery shops, banks, dry cleaners and notaries. People are allowed to walk near their homes, provided they maintain social distancing and wear masks. Driving is allowed from 18 May with a permit sticker from 07.00 to 10.00 (local time) and from 17.00 to 20.00 for essential shopping or work. Intercity and inter-regional vehicular movement remains restricted, except for government employees and for those with permits. As of 15 May, sectors including handicraft, maintenance of agricultural machinery and electronic appliance, rent and lease, and accounting, auditing as well as tax consulting have been allowed to operate.\\nThe yellow level applies to regions where COVID-19 cases have not been confirmed within the last 14 days, but where COVID-19 patients are undergoing treatment. This category includes Tashkent, as well as Khorezm and Surkhandarya regions. The same movement restrictions under the red quarantine level apply. However, more businesses are allowed to reopen, including non-food stores, florists, jewellers, hotels, and hair and beauty salons. Taxis are permitted, along with bicycles and scooters. Starting from 15 May, businesses including real estate, advertising and marketing, private employment agencies have been able to resume. In the meantime, people have been allowed to visit parks from 09.00 to 20.00 in strict compliance with social distancing guidelines. People will be allowed to drive between 06.00 to 22.00 from 18 may.\\nThe green level applies to regions that have no confirmed COVID-19 cases or where all patients have recovered. Jizzakh, Kashkadarya and Navoi regions have been designated as green zones. From 15 May, open-air stadiums and museums are allowed to reopen with a limited number of visitors. In addition to the activities allowed under the red and yellow quarantine levels, permits are not required to drive cars from 18 May.\\nThe country\\u2019s national carrier, Uzbekistan Airways, will restart a limited number of domestic passenger flights from 18 May. Travellers will need to present a health certificate showing they have tested negative for COVID-19 before being allowed to board. In addition, passengers will be required to pass the coronavirus infection test at the Center for Sanitary and Epidemiological Surveillance no more than 120 hours before departure.\\nPeople who need to go outside for urgent matters are required to wear masks in public places, while gatherings of more than three people, with the exception of groups involving members of the same family, are banned. Visitors to supermarkets and other essential stores should be prepared to have their temperature taken; those with a temperature deemed abnormal will be denied access and advised to seek medical support. Individuals may also conduct trips to and from their workplace provided it is in an approved sector.
