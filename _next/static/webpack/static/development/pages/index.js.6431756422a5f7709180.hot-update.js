Railway and passenger flights have started to resume accordingly with the lifting of restrictions (Wuhan Tianhe International Airport resumed domestic flights on 8 April); however, international flights and flights to/from Beijing will remain suspended until further notice. Those who want to leave Hubei should confirm with their destination city on the local requirements. Various cities and provinces require all travellers from Wuhan to take nucleic acid tests (including Shenzhen, Zhejiang, etc). Shanghai encourages employers to let returning staff from certain areas take nucleic acid tests.\\nBeijing: On 29 April, the Beijing government announced a new policy that business travellers and returnees who come from domestic \\u2018COVID-19 low risk\\u2019 areas to Beijing will NOT need the 14 days of home quarantine. People who have travelled from low risk areas to Beijing and are currently under home quarantine can halt their home quarantine and medical observation if applicable. The new Beijing policy does not apply to travellers from overseas, Hubei province or other domestic \\u2018medium and high risk areas\\u2019. Personnel returning from Hubei need to register information online in advance and get a negative nucleic acid test certificate before purchasing the returning ticket.

The latest city is Suifenhe, the border city with Russia in Heilongjiang province, who adjusted its risk level to low from May 6. However, some cities also chose to strengthen their quarantine measures due to re-emergence of local or imported cases. On 10 May, Shulan (Jilin province) raised its risk level to \\u2018high\\u2019 due to new local cases, and has re-strengthened restrictions on local movement and public gathering. Several train routes to/from Shulan have also been suspended.All villages and residential compounds in the city were closed off, and only one person from each household allowed out for two hours every second day for essentials. (The Guardian, 19.05.2020) \\n\\nAnother example is Taiyuan (who did so on 3 May), Shanxi provincial capital, although it didn\\u2019t announce any change to its risk or response level. In Shanghai and Guangdong, public health emergency response levels have been changed from level II to level III.\\nA new directive has been issued providing more detailed guidance on community quarantine management, including a new clause that says for low-risk areas and communities with no cases detected, inbound travellers from non-high-risk areas are exempted from mandatory quarantine as long as they hold a \\u2018green\\u2019 health code and arrive directly (without a stopover in a high-risk area). As the risk levels still vary across the country, travellers are advised to confirm with the local residence committee or hotel about quarantine requirements in advance.\\nAs each province has different variations of the application, travellers will need to check the relevant application for their destination and register their information online to get the \\u2018health code\\u2019 before the trip. Heilongjiang announced an \\u2018in-city code\\u2019 in addition to the three-colour health code. Personnel with \\u2018in-city code\\u2019 are restricted to travel out of their current city but can move freely inside.\\nAlthough such restrictions are easing, many provinces and cities still have in place community 'close-off' style management which means:\\nA reduction of exit/entry access to the community.\\nAccess control of visitors and visiting vehicles: ID check/registration, temperature measurement at gate, delivery service is to be picked up at the gate of community etc.\\nIf there are confirmed cases in a certain community, there might be a closure of certain units/areas for quarantine depending on the severity of the local outbreak.

Exemptions can also be made for travellers who receive permission from a South Korean Embassy to travel for the purposes of business, humanitarian work or participation in an academic forum. A fast-track procedure has been introduced to facilitate business travel with China. Business travellers from China need to submit a document certifying a negative COVID-19 test result within 72 hours before departure and satisfy the disease control requirement. A quarantine exemption document will then be issued by the Korean authorities. Once the traveller undergoes another COVID-19 testing upon arrival in South Korea with a negative test result, the person can enter the country and engage in business activities while under active surveillance. Travellers with symptoms of COVID-19 will be escorted to an isolation facility for further COVID-19 testing (travellers without symptoms will also be tested for COVID-19 in a separate facility). If test results are positive, patients will be escorted to designated hospitals or other medical facilities for treatment. All violators (incl. foreigners) of the self-quarantine requirement will be punished by relevant statutory law. International travellers can transit if they do not clear immigration and stay within the transit area for up to 24 hours. Visitors who have been in Hubei province (China) in the past 14 days are not allowed to transit or enter South Korea. Nationals of China with a passport issued in Hubei province are not allowed to enter South Korea. Korean visas issued by the Wuhan consulate in Hubei province are invalidated. Suspension of all visa-free entry to Chinese nationals and foreign nationals who are traveling from China. Airlines are required to check the body temperature of all travellers to South Korea prior to departure. Travellers with a body temperature higher than 37.5 degrees Celsius will be denied entry. All travellers are advised to use private vehicles to transit to their place of residence from the airport. Those who do not have access to private vehicles are to use designated buses and trains allocated for these travellers. Visas issued to nationals of Japan (at Korean diplomatic missions in Japan) before 9 March 2020 are invalidated and visa exemption has been suspended. This does not apply to visas issued outside Japan; such visas remain valid. This also does not apply to airline crew. Nationals of Japan who do not hold a Korean visa issued on or after 9 March 2020 will not be allowed entry.\\nVisa-free entry to Jeju Island is temporarily suspended to all foreign nationals.\\n\\nInternal restrictions:\\nThe country\\u2019s COVID-19 alert level has remained at RED (the highest on a four-tier scale) since 23 February.

(Reuters, 13.05.2020) \\n\\nInternal restrictions:\\nGovernment plans to extend state of emergency until 6 June. This gives the government emergency powers to impose limitations on movement and impose other extraordinary measures. Countrywide restrictions on movement remain in force and residents have been asked to remain at home except to go to work, to buy food, medicines and other essentials, or in the event of emergencies. However infants under the age of 14 allowed out for one hour. The wearing of face masks on public transport was made compulsory from 4 May. Hotels and short-stay accommodation (such as short-stay campsites or caravan parks) are closed. The measures do not apply to long-term accommodation, such as long-stay campsites, as long as travellers can cater for themselves and do not rely on communal facilities, which will be closed.\\n\\nRelaxation of restrictions\\nThe gradual relaxation of restrictions began from 4 May, starting with lifting minor restrictions on internal movement. The government is planning to start gradually easing the restrictions as follows. Each autonomous regional government will be able to modify restrictions depending on local realities and all dates remain approximate depending on the evolution of sanitary context. From 4 May, phase 0: appointment based services were allowed to reopen such as hairdressers, dentists, beauty parlours. In the Canary and Balearic islands, phase 1 will start on 4 May unlike the rest of the country (mainland) - see below. From 11 May, phase 1: bars, terraces and restaurants will be able to reopen only to a third of their capacity in selected areas. Bookstores and museums will be allowed to operate to 40% of their capacity. Family members will be allowed to attend funerals. Small gatherings will be allowed for \\u2018healthy individuals, with no vulnerabilities and no underlying conditions\\u2019. Hotels may reopen past this time, with a limited guest number of a third of their capacity and without the use of common spaces. Religious places may also reopen under the same restrictions. Territories authorised to proceed in phase 1 are listed on the Ministry of Health website. From 25 May, phase 2, theatres, cinemas and other cultural locations will be open to a third of their capacity. Weddings may include family members and friends past this phase but no further details are available as of yet. From 8 June, phase 3, food and beverage commerce may open to 50% of their capacity and travel within one\\u2019s region of accommodation. Some restrictions have already been lifted for some non-essential workers who are not able to work from home (e.g. the construction sector), while some factories have also been permitted to resume operations.\\nThe authorities continue to recommend that citizens respect social distancing measures and wear face masks. Further details will be made available closer to those dates. Inter-regional travel may be relaxed from 22 June. Universities will remain closed until September. Schools will reopen gradually, with some exceptions to accommodate small children of essential workers. On 11 May, the national train operator Renfe began resuming normal service to suburbs with increased frequencies to ensure social distancing measures and avoid overcrowding. The return to normal operations will be gradual in Madrid, Barcelona and the other ten cities where it operates.\",\"Effective May 15, passengers arriving in Spain from other countries will be required to quarantine at their home/place of accommodation for the 14 days immediately following their arrival.
