Exemptions can also be made for travellers who receive permission from a South Korean Embassy to travel for the purposes of business, humanitarian work or participation in an academic forum.

Travellers with symptoms of COVID-19 will be escorted to an isolation facility for further COVID-19 testing (travellers without symptoms will also be tested for COVID-19 in a separate facility). If test results are positive, patients will be escorted to designated hospitals or other medical facilities for treatment. All violators (incl. foreigners) of the self-quarantine requirement will be punished by relevant statutory law. International travellers can transit if they do not clear immigration and stay within the transit area for up to 24 hours.
