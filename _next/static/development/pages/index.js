Railway and passenger flights have started to resume accordingly with the lifting of restrictions (Wuhan Tianhe International Airport resumed domestic flights on 8 April); however, international flights and flights to/from Beijing will remain suspended until further notice. Those who want to leave Hubei should confirm with their destination city on the local requirements. Various cities and provinces require all travellers from Wuhan to take nucleic acid tests (including Shenzhen, Zhejiang, etc). Shanghai encourages employers to let returning staff from certain areas take nucleic acid tests.\\nBeijing: On 29 April, the Beijing government announced a new policy that business travellers and returnees who come from domestic \\u2018COVID-19 low risk\\u2019 areas to Beijing will NOT need the 14 days of home quarantine. People who have travelled from low risk areas to Beijing and are currently under home quarantine can halt their home quarantine and medical observation if applicable. The new Beijing policy does not apply to travellers from overseas, Hubei province or other domestic \\u2018medium and high risk areas\\u2019. Personnel returning from Hubei need to register information online in advance and get a negative nucleic acid test certificate before purchasing the returning ticket. After arrival, they need to show the test certificate to enter the community, follow the 14-day quarantine requirement, and take another test before lifting the quarantine. Domestic travellers planning to stay at hotels must present a \\u2018green\\u2019 health code. Chaoyang District has been rated as \\u2018high\\u2019 risk due to recent cluster cases.

As such requirements vary across the country, travellers need to confirm with the local residence committee or hotel in advance.\\nAs the situation continues to improve across the country, almost all the cities and provinces have declared the local risk level to be low. The latest city is Suifenhe, the border city with Russia in Heilongjiang province, who adjusted its risk level to low from May 6. However, some cities also chose to strengthen their quarantine measures due to re-emergence of local or imported cases. On 10 May, Shulan (Jilin province) raised its risk level to \\u2018high\\u2019 due to new local cases, and has re-strengthened restrictions on local movement and public gathering. Several train routes to/from Shulan have also been suspended.All villages and residential compounds in the city were closed off, and only one person from each household allowed out for two hours every second day for essentials.

In Shanghai and Guangdong, public health emergency response levels have been changed from level II to level III.\\nA new directive has been issued providing more detailed guidance on community quarantine management, including a new clause that says for low-risk areas and communities with no cases detected, inbound travellers from non-high-risk areas are exempted from mandatory quarantine as long as they hold a \\u2018green\\u2019 health code and arrive directly (without a stopover in a high-risk area). As the risk levels still vary across the country, travellers are advised to confirm with the local residence committee or hotel about quarantine requirements in advance.\\nAs each province has different variations of the application, travellers will need to check the relevant application for their destination and register their information online to get the \\u2018health code\\u2019 before the trip. Heilongjiang announced an \\u2018in-city code\\u2019 in addition to the three-colour health code. Personnel with \\u2018in-city code\\u2019 are restricted to travel out of their current city but can move freely inside.\\nAlthough such restrictions are easing, many provinces and cities still have in place community 'close-off' style management which means:\\nA reduction of exit/entry access to the community.\\nAccess control of visitors and visiting vehicles: ID check/registration, temperature measurement at gate, delivery service is to be picked up at the gate of community etc.\\nIf there are confirmed cases in a certain community, there might be a closure of certain units/areas for quarantine depending on the severity of the local outbreak.
